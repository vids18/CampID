# SportsID
The summer of 2020 was all about exploring new learnt Data Science and Machine Learning concepts in the Masters program into the buisness world by learning from experts and colleagues in my internship. But neither did anyone of us know that the pandemic will play a spoil sport to all those dreams. But fortunately I was able to carry on with my summer internship virtually.

# CampID
CampID is the first product of SportsID where I was a part with the other Data Science enthusiasts. I worked as a Data Science (Operations) intern to develop recommendation system for people accessing the sports camp in the USA.

- Partnered with internal stakeholders on CampID project to identify and articulate the location of existing Sports Camps that identifies solutions to raise the bar for starting new camps
- Executed all-spectrum data analysis and modeling of sports data to validate and improve results for camps in the USA to about 75%
- Analyzed and exhibited trends for the sport taught in these camps using publicly available data analysis and visualization tools
- Fabricated a recommendation system based on the location, sports, skills possessed, age, and gender
- Worked closely with web developers and technical experts to integrate the developed back-end solution with the front-end data using Flask framework
